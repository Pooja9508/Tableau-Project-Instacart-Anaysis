## What is Instacart? 

Insta cart is a company that helps people get groceries from multiple stores like Wegmanâ€™s, Costco, Walmart and more without even leaving the house. 

## Process
In this project I have utilized a dataset sourced from Kaggle as the foundation for my analysis. Leveraging Python, I conducted comprehensive data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to ensure accuracy and derive valuable insights. Additionally, I constructed interactive Tableau dashboards to visually represent these insights, enabling a more intuitive understanding of the data patterns and facilitating informed decision-making processes.
